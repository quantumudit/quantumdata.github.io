  ðŸ“Š I'm a Numbers Guy and I crunch numbers to create insightful stories ðŸ“Š
</b>

<p>
  It all started when I saw one of my seniors creating visuals in a spreadsheet
  around five years ago; the numbers that are so cluttered, suddenly started
  providing actionable insights with the click of an button. That's the point
  when I discovered data analytics as my passion.
</p>

<p>
  From that day onwards; I'm up-skilling myself in this domain and I love to
  share my thoughts in public communities. This blog is a small contribution
  from my end with a hope to make some impact in the larger data community.
