<b>I'm a Numbers Guy who can make stories out of your data !!</b>

<p>
    Being an experienced data analyst & business intelligence consultant, I have a demonstrated history of working in statistical data analysis, insights mining & business analytics.
</p>

<p>
    In the last 5 years, I've worked on various analytics and BI tools such as, Power BI, Tableau, Alteryx, MSBI Stack (SSIS, SSAS, SSMS, SSRS), Python, SQL, UI Path, etc. and across various domains like Manufacturing, Food & Retail, Market Research, Finance & Social Media
</p>

<p>
    I like to empower and educate people in the field of data and I do this by actively participating, contributing and sharing in community forums like Power BI Community, Alteryx Community, Enterprise DNA Community, LinkedIn, etc.
</p>

    Working with data is not just a part of my professional curriculum but, it's my passion too that not only helps me achieve more but, makes me inspire others to achieve more.

    As a data geek, I can summarize my experience with data by the following quote :
    <b><i>Data talks a lot; how much we understand is upto us ðŸ“Š</i></b>
