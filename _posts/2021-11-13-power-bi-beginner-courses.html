  Power BI is undoubtedly an amazing business intelligence tool that we
  currently have in the market and with growing demands for data analytics; it becomes really important to know this particular tool.
</p>

<p>
  When I was a beginner in Power BI; I struggled to find the proper content from
  where should I start?
</p>

<p>
  Although we have a lot of content on Power BI present online, still beginners
  struggle to find the appropriate content to get started.
</p>

<p>
  So, here I will point out a couple of courses that I think could be helpful
  for anyone getting started with Power BI
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>
  It is okay to begin Power BI afresh but, having a basic knowledge of Pivot
  Tables is helpful.

<h3>Power BI Beginner Friendly Courses</h3>

<p>
    I must say that Power BI has a steep learning curve and there are several things that we need to understand before becoming a pro in it; however, I will discuss these in some other posts.
    <br />
    Here are two good courses available for free over YouTube by <a href="https://portal.enterprisedna.co/">Enterprise DNA</a> that I would recommend to everyone:

    </ul>
</p>

<p>
There are many other fantastic & beginner friendly courses available today but, I've decided not to overwhelm this particular post by providing links for too many courses; however, I'll keep on posting my choice of course recommendation in future posts.
