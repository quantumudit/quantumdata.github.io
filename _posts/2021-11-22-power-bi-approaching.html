    When I opened Power BI Desktop for the very first time; it seemed pretty easy to me as I was a little familiar with Excel and Tableau but, very soon I realized that it's not so easy as it seems.
</p>
<p>
    Well, I discovered a similar kind of experience happens with almost anyone who doesn't have any prior experience in working with data modeling, Power Pivot, etc.
</p>
<p>
    So, in this post, I'll discuss the correct approach through which one must understand & learn Power BI to flatten the learning curve.
</p>
<h3>Constituents of Power BI</h3>
<p>
    Power BI can be understood as a combination of the following three components:
    <ul>
        <li>Data Transformation Component</li>
        <li>Data Modelling Component</li>
        <li>Data Visualization Component</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Data Transformation Component</h4>
<p>
    The Power Query Editor comes with a Power BI desktop and acts just like an ETL tool where we can transform our raw data into a machine-friendly dataset.
</p>
<h4>Data Modelling Component</h4>
<p>
    The Power Query Editor comes with a Power BI desktop and acts just like an ETL tool where we can transform our raw data into a machine-friendly dataset.
</p>
<h4>Data Modelling Component</h4>
<p>
Once we have the transformed data with us; we can create a data model by creating relationships between the fact and dimension tables.
</p>
<p>
Without a proper data model; there is a high chance that we will face immense difficulties in doing some easy tasks and have to write heavy and complex DAX formulae that will create visual rendering issues.
</p>
<h4>Data Visualization Component</h4>
<p>
    Once we have the model (along with required DAX measures and calculated columns); we can now visualize our data to generate insights in the canvas.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, rather than jumping into visualization by importing and dragging fields from the dataset; we must settle down for a bit and make sure that we are following the proper approach as discussed.
