<p>
    It wouldn't be wrong if I say that the most asked question on my LinkedIn messages is about the tips and tricks to crack the DA-100/Exam.
</p>
<p>
    So, this particular blog post is exactly dedicated to the learning path that I've followed to crack the DA-100 exam. <em>(I am assuming that you are somewhat aware of the DA-100 exam and what it represents.)</em>
</p>
<p>
    The preparation journey can be broadly classified into the following 4 steps:
    <ul>
        <li>Knowing the Syllabus</li>
        <li>Learning the Concepts</li>
        <li>Practicing the Concepts</li>
        <li>Giving the Mock Test</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Knowing the Syllabus</h3>
<p>
    The best source to get familiar with the syllabus is the Microsoft Learn site itself. Here goes the DA-100 Syllabus link:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/da-100"><u>Microsoft Learn DA-100 Information</u></a></li>
    </ul>
    The above link not only has a detailed syllabus but also has a comprehensive learning path that one can follow and practice.
</p>
<h3>Learning the Concepts</h3>
<p>
    Today we have a lot of resources for learning the concepts used in Power BI; however, I would like to specifically outline 2 courses on DA-100 that I followed. Here go the links:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://training.bielite.com/courses/da-100-exam-prep-power-bi-certification/"><u>BI ELITE Course on DA-100</u></a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/exam-da-100-a-complete-guide-on-acing-the-exam-with-powerbi/"><u>DA-100 course on Udemy by SuperDataScience Team</u></a></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Practicing the Concepts</h3>
<p>
    Learning without practicing can be detrimental and I strongly recommend practicing the concepts while studying them and in this way, learning becomes much easier.
</p>
<p>
    We now have several sources that run free weekly/monthly challenges where beginners can upskill themselves in Power BI. The four popular sources that I can provide are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.workout-wednesday.com/power-bi-challenges/"><u>Workout Wednesday Power BI Challenges</u></a></li>
        <li><a href="https://forum.enterprisedna.co/c/problem-of-the-week/"><u>Power BI Accelerator Program</u></a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground"><u>Maven Analytics Data Playground</u></a></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Giving the Mock Test</h3>
<p>
    Once you feel comfortable on a module; you can test your knowledge by giving quality mock tests for free on the following website:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.learndatainsights.com/power-bi-quiz-da-100/"><u>Learn Data Insights DA-100 Quiz</u></a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    By giving this mock test; you'll get an overall idea about the type of questions being asked in the exam along with their difficulty level
</p>
<p>
    Above all; I would advise <strong><em>not to give DA-100 exam for just getting certified but; to learn Power BI.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are plenty of amazing resources to learn Power BI; however, I only picked the sources that I've tried in this blog and I would love to hear from you in case you know about any good resources on Power BI.
</p>

All the very best and Happy Analyzing !!! üëçüìà
