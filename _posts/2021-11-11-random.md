Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world
as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round
earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center
because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy
as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a
globe in practice, not in theory.

Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and
evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about
technological dangers also come from science.

A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing
her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt
seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish
her.
